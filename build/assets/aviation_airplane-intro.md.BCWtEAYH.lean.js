The key forces are:</p><ul><li><strong>Thrust</strong>: The forward force, equal to drag plus the component of weight along the flight path.</li><li><strong>Drag</strong>: The resistive force opposite to thrust.</li><li><strong>Lift</strong>: The upward force generated by the wings, perpendicular to the direction of flight.</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: The gravitational force pulling the aircraft down. The weight has two components in a climb: one along the flight path (W sin α) and one perpendicular to the flight path (W cos α).</li></ul><p>Lift is less than weight during a climb.</p><ul><li><strong>Thrust = Drag + W sin α</strong></li><li><strong>Lift = W cos α</strong> (where α is the angle of climb)</li></ul><h2 id="review" tabindex="-1">Review: <a class="header-anchor" href="#review" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Review:&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p>There are four forces that act on an airplane in flight – lift, weight, thrust, and drag. Lift is the force that acts upward, against gravity. Thrust propels the airplane forward, and drag acts opposite of thrust.</p></li><li><p>A Swiss mathematician, Daniel Bernoulli, found that, as the speed of the air increases, its pressure will decrease.</p></li><li><p>The upper surface of a wing is curved and the lower surface is relatively flat. As air flow meets the wing, the air flowing over the top curve, or camber, increases speed decreasing the pressure on top of the wing. This decreased pressure is the major source of the lift needed to make the airplane fly.</p></li><li><p>The front part of a wing is called the leading edge and the back is called the trailing edge. In cross section, an imaginary line drawn between the leading edge and the trailing edge is called the wing chord.</p></li><li><p>An airplane has three axis of movement – the longitudinal axis which passes through the length of the airplane, the lateral axis which passes through the wings, and the vertical axis, which passes through the body of the airplane perpendicular to the other two axes.</p></li><li><p>To maneuver an airplane you must control its movement around these three axes. This is done by moving the primary control surfaces – the elevator, ailerons, and rudder.</p></li><li><p>Ailerons control roll, pitch is controlled by the elevator, and the rudder controls yaw.</p></li><li><p>Pulling the yoke back moves the elevator to rotate the airplane around the lateral axis pitching the nose up. Pushing the yoke forward pitches the nose down.</p></li><li><p>Turning the control yoke moves the ailerons. Turn it right, right aileron is up and the left one is down, and the airplane banks right. Move the control yoke left and the left aileron is up and the right one is down, banking the airplane to the left. The bank will normally continue to increase until the ailerons are returned to the neutral position.</p></li><li><p>Pushing the right rudder pedal moves the rudder to the right and the airplane’s nose yaws to the right. Push the left rudder, and the nose goes left. Yawing the nose is not necessarily turning the airplane.</p></li><li><p>In turning flight, the rudder&#39;s function is to counteract adverse yaw which occurs when the airplane is rolled into a turn and when it&#39;s rolled back to wings level flight.</p></li><li><p>A trim tab is used to relieve the pressure needed to hold a primary control surface out of the streamlined position. In many cases, elevator trim can be adjusted in flight. In some airplanes it can only be adjusted on the ground.</p></li><li><p>The flaps are the movable panels on the trailing edge of the inboard parts of the wings. Both flaps are extended and retracted at the same time. Lowering the flaps increases both lift and drag.</p></li><li><p>Extending the flaps allows the landing approach to be steeper and slower. In some situations flaps are also used to shorten the takeoff run.</p></li></ol>',8)]))}const g=t(n,[["render",o]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
