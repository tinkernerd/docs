This is commonly referred to as the go/no-go decision. Even though at this stage of your education your flight instructor will help you make this decision, it’s important that you learn to analyze conditions for yourself. The decision is made based on several factors. One of the most important factors is the existing weather conditions.</p><p>Factors:</p><ul><li>Weather</li><li>Visibility</li><li>Wind</li><li>Cloud Cover <ul><li>Celling</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="review" tabindex="-1">Review: <a class="header-anchor" href="#review" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Review:&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li>Before ever leaving the ground, each pilot must make an important decision. Whether to fly or not, commonly referred to as the go no-go decision. And even though you&#39;re a student pilot, the operative word is pilot, and you, along with your instructor, should make this decision each lesson based on several factors, among these factors is weather.</li><li>Anytime of the year can be a great time to fly. Summer&#39;s warm weather typically offers many flyable days. But summer storms are not to be trifled with and are always a reason to delay a flight if they are near. Winter typically offers the clearest air of the four seasons, and since cold air is more dense than warm air, aircraft performance is at its peak.</li><li>Visibility is another factor to consider – three miles is the lowest practical visibility.</li><li>Ideally, you always want to takeoff and land into the wind. But this isn&#39;t always possible and you&#39;ll learn to negotiate crosswinds with ease later in your training.</li><li>Be aware of the wind. Even clear days could have difficult wind conditions beyond your ability.</li><li>The type and amount of cloud cover must also be analyzed. Visual flight rules specify a minimum ceiling height of 1,000 feet above the ground.</li><li>Clouds may become a ceiling that you can’t legally penetrate. A ceiling is the lowest cloud layer that covers most of the sky. If it’s solid, it’s called overcast. A broken ceiling is simply an overcast with a few holes in it.</li><li>As you begin training, you’ll fly mostly during the day. Later, you’ll enjoy learning to fly at night.</li></ol>',6)]))}const f=t(l,[["render",n]]);export{c as __pageData,f as default};
